GRAPES - GRaylevel Analysis of PArticlES 

GRAPES is a python toolkit originally developed for the radial analysis of grey level intensities in x-ray tomograms of particles. This allows for quantitative analysis of core-shell behaviour. See the paper at https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-msbc1 .
