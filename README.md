# GRAPES

GRAPES (**GR**eylevel **A**nalysis of **P**articl**ES**) is a python toolkit originally developed for the radial analysis of grey level intensities in x-ray tomograms of particles. This allows for quantitative analysis of core-shell behaviour and internal cracking and void formation. For an example use cases and methodology see the paper (preprint) available at https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-msbc1

The GRAPES.py file contains functions for calculating a pandas table of particles and particle properties, as well as functions for analyzing particle data sets, as well as utility functions (plotting, I/O etc.). Central to the toolkit is the inclusion of radial layer properties, for example mean grey-level intensity in radial layers can be calculated rapidly across a large dataset of particles using the GREAT2 method.
